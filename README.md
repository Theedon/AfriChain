# African AI Foundation Recruitment

## Project Description

Implement a Python-based langchain agent with the following capabilities:

1. **Querying a Database:** The agent should be able to query a database using the Northwind DB hosted [here](https://github.com/jpwhite3/northwind-SQLite3/blob/main/dist/northwind.db). Tools like [SQLite Viewer](https://inloop.github.io/sqlite-viewer/) or [SQLite Viewer](https://sqliteviewer.app/) can be used to view the data structure and content of the Northwind DB.

2. **Integration with Public APIs:** Integrate the agent with any public free API endpoint, such as [restful-api.dev](https://restful-api.dev/) or [7 Free Public APIs You Will Love as a Developer](https://dev.to/ruppysuppy/7-free-public-apis-you-will-love-as-a-developer-166p). Bonus points for integrating multiple APIs and including one that requires authentication.

The agent should expose a single FAST API endpoint allowing queries in natural language via POSTMAN. It should automatically determine the appropriate tool to engage and respond with accurate information.

## Additional Instructions

- Create a 5-minute video recording demonstrating interaction with the endpoint via POSTMAN.
- Bonus: Share a URL to a Python service hosted on [render.com](https://render.com/) or [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/).
- Email the Loom video URL and hosted Python service URL to recruitment@africanaifoundation.com.
- Deadline: 10th of June, 2024.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the environment and install dependencies.
3. Run the FastAPI server.
4. Access the FastAPI endpoint using POSTMAN.
